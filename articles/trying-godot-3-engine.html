        <h1>Trying Godot 3 engine</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>I've never used a full blown game engine to make a simple video game before, and out of three great game engines, I picked Godot for this simple 2D game, not to mention excellent cross-platform executable generator.</p>

        <p>It's quite interesting on how Godot actually let you model the game objects (nodes) with its user friendly interface. Every Flaps was made with GDScript, the game engine scripting language provided by Godot. It's very familiar to me due to the Python syntactical similarities. It was a breeze although has some difference regarding classes (i.e, a scene is also a class and can be instanced and inherited). It caught me off guard in the first place, but the reasoning behind it does makes sense as it ensures tighter and greater integration with how the user would use the engine.</p>

        <p>In Every Flaps, states are managed with imperative global variables mutations with basic vector and hash map. Nothing fancy like classes or multiple object instances (although I did that before, but removed due to unnecessary complexities introduced).</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/momozor/every_flaps">result</a> is embarassingly bad at the moment of this writing as I'm not familiar with game development domain in general, very badly written code in a hurry and I don't really have the time to continue polishing it (maybe later in the future?), but the experimentation experience was great and enjoyable!</p>
        <p>I would certainly give Godot a try if I want to make a new (and more polished) game in the future, well if it comes to that. ^^</p>
