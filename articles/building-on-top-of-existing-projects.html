        <h1>Building on top of existing projects</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>I've come to the point where starting projects from scratch is really wasting time and even more so for learning purpose. Why? With the abundance of
            free and open source code out there, I'm not sure how could I say no to studying , poking around, making changes, refactoring existing codebase is far
            more productive compared to writing your own bug ridden, untested, fragile and most likely will be incomplete work.</p>

        <p>Is it because of NIH syndrome that really drives me to write new project from scratch every single time? Or is it because I think code that I will write on my own will always result in great quality product and far more maintainable codebase than work made by other people? Of course, there are bad code out there, but those bad code also tend to already provide you with a concrete implementation of an idea that you wanted to realize. So, why not improving that existing bad code instead of rewriting or writing a new project from scratch?</p>

        <p>Well, of course, if writing project from scratch does provide obvious advantage in productivity and maintainability than reusing or building on top of existing projects, then you should go for the former.</p>

        <p>So yes, my first priority for hobby projects that I'm going to work on next and so on will to be reusing existing codebases of mine and others. I've underestimated the <i>"
standing on the shoulders of giants"</i> saying. </p>
