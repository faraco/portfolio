        <h1>My preferred Common Lisp style guide</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Personally, I really like <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/lispguide.xml">Google's Common Lisp</a> and
            <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/style-guide/">lisp.lang.org</a> style guides. They are excellent compiled references if you are looking for on how to organize your code properly.</p>

        <p>However, if you ask me, I would like some minimal changes out of both of them. Those are:
            <ul>
                <li>Append ! to a procedure name to mark it that the procedure would mutate global or variables that are passed to the procedure. Example: <code>(defun mutator! (x) (setf x 7))</code></li>
                <li>Use ? instead of p or -p. Example: <code>(defun mutating? (x) (not x))</code> or <code>(defun currently-mutating? (x) (not x))</code></li>
            </ul>
            
            Yeah. My preference looks like Scheme code style, and it's true.
            I really like if I can differentiate between if a function/procedure would be "destructive" in FP sense.
            It's also helpful to know on when to prioritize which procedure might cause trouble in unit testing as well.
            The biggest issue is, this style may look cluttered when you are mixing libraries code that follows the "commonly used" (similar to Google's, mostly) style.
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to macros, this would be a good <a href="http://random-state.net/log/3390120648.html">reference</a> as well.</p>
        <p>Of course, like any style guides, just don't treat them as infallible source of truth, I would say. Consistency is the key.</p>
