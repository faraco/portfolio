            <h1>About</h1>
            <hr>

            <p>Love to pet cats (meow meow), dabbling with LISPs (mostly Common Lisp), underlying of Unix-like systems, automated testing, horror novels, and heavy metal music. Prefers to stay away from politic discussions most of the time, unless they are and would be interesting also important to me. I sometimes play random musical instruments including a bamboo flute and an acoustic guitar. When I'm bored, I just go for a jog and simply being physically active with other various health beneficial exercises. For me, a 5KM run and weights lifting a day really helps with squishing the stress out.</p>

            <p>I'm sort of an enthusiast when it comes to reading manga, webtoon comics and being a furry too. </p>
